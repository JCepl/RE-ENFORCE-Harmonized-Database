# Barkbeetle validation data

## Description
The dataset represents wind/bark beetle complex damage derived from the European Forest Disturbance Atlas (https://zenodo.org/records/13333034).
The data was reprojected to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326) and the resolution was resampled (average method for quantitative trait) to 30 arc-seconds (~1km).
The data covers from 1985 to 2023.
