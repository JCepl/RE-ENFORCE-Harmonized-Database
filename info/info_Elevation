Elevation (EU-DEM, Copernicus)

Description
Raster dataset representing terrain elevation (meters above sea level) derived from the EU-DEM dataset provided by Copernicus.
Tiles were downloaded from Eurostat GISCO, stitched together, and cropped to the defined European extent 
to provide a continuous elevation surface for the RE-ENFORCE domain.

Data details
File: Elevation_EU.tif
Type: static raster
Resolution: 30 arc-seconds (~1 km)
Units: meters above sea level (m a.s.l.)

Use
Provides the base topographic layer for deriving terrain variables (slope, aspect) 
and for adjusting climatic or ecological models according to elevation-dependent gradients across Europe.
