**Original projection:**  
WGS 84 geographic coordinates (EPSG: 4326)

**Original resolution:**  
30 m × 30 m grid

**Processing:**  
- Reprojected to 30″ (~1 km) grid  
- Aggregated by averaging canopy height values per cell

**Use:**  
Represents tree canopy height across Europe for 2021, used in modelling degradation drivers. Provides spatially explicit estimates of canopy height suitable for integration with biomass, land-cover, 
and disturbance datasets in forest structure and habitat-vulnerability analyses.

## Notes

Raster dataset representing tree canopy height (in meters) for the year 2021 across Europe.
Derived from Landsat time series calibrated using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spaceborne GEDI lidar data.
Part of a broader dataset describing both canopy extent and height change over multiple years, 
though here only the most up-to-date (2021) height layer is used for forest structure assessment.
