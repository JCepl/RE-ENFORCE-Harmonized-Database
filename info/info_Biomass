Forest Biomass (Valerio 2022)

Description
Raster dataset representing forest biomass available for wood supply (BAWS) for the year 2020 across the EU27.
The data quantify the biomass potentially available for harvesting, excluding protected and non-productive forest areas.
Values are expressed as tons of dry matter per hectare (t/ha).
