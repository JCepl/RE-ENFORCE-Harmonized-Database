Slope (Derived from EU-DEM)

Description
Raster dataset representing the slope steepness of the terrain, derived from the EU-DEM elevation model (Copernicus).
Slope indicates the rate of elevation change across the surface, expressed as angular degrees from horizontal.

Source
Derived from EU-DEM (Copernicus) elevation data using standard terrain analysis tools (e.g., terrain(..., v = "slope") in GIS).

Use
Represents terrain steepness, used to model runoff potential, soil erosion risk, 
and site accessibility, and to support the derivation of other topographic or ecological variables.
