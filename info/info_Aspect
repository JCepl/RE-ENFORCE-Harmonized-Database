Aspect (Derived from EU-DEM)

Description
Raster dataset representing the compass direction (aspect) of slopes derived from the EU-DEM elevation model under the Copernicus programme.
Aspect describes the orientation a slope faces on the terrain surface, expressed as categorical compass sectors.

Source
Derived from EU-DEM (Copernicus) elevation data.
Computation based on surface slope orientation using standard topographic analysis (e.g., terrain(..., v = "aspect") in GIS).
