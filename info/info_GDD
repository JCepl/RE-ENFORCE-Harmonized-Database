Growing Degree Days (Bark Beetle Generations)

Description
The dataset represents accumulated Growing Degree Days (GDD) derived from monthly CHELSA temperature rasters, calibrated for bark beetle development modelling in Central and Northern Europe.
It quantifies thermal conditions suitable for the completion of one or more Ips typographus generations per year.

Computation procedure (summary)

Input data: monthly mean air temperature rasters (tavg_final_FULL_EUR.tif) from CHELSA.
Temperature limits:
Base temperature (T<sub>base</sub>) = 8.3 °C
Upper threshold (T<sub>max</sub>) = 38.9 °C
For each raster cell and month:
Values above T<sub>max</sub> capped to T<sub>max</sub>.
T<sub>base</sub> subtracted from each temperature value.
Negative results set to 0.
Monthly GDD multiplied by the number of days in the month.
Only April–October months considered (period of beetle activity).
Aggregated over 25 years to produce annual sums of effective thermal units.

Output
Raster file: GDD_now_EU.tif
Format: GeoTIFF (GTiff)
Resolution: same as CHELSA input (30 arc-seconds ≈ 1 km)
Projection: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)
Units: number of potential bark beetle generations per year

Use
Provides a spatially explicit indicator of climatic suitability for bark beetle reproduction, used in combination with forest and land-cover layers to estimate outbreak potential and habitat vulnerability.
