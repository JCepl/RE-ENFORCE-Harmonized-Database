CORINE Land Cover data

Three different spatial expansions:
●	Interreg-CE
●	Interreg-CE Countries (includes whole Germany and Italy)
●	Europe

Three zone types with defined CORINE land cover classes:
●	Forest zone
○	3.1.1 = Broad-leaved forest
○	3.1.2 = Coniferous forest
○	3.1.3 = Mixed forest
●	Buffer zone
○	3.2.2 = Moors and heathland
○	3.2.3 = Sclerophyllous vegetation
○	3.2.4 = Transitional woodland/shrub
○	3.3.4 = Burnt areas
●	Fire zone (land classes for modelling fire)
○	2.3.1 = Pastures
○	3.2.1 = Natural grassland

For the Interreg-CE files, information on the country, zone type, and CORINE land cover class is available. For Europe as a whole, only information on the zone type and CORINE land cover class is included.
